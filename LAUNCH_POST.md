# click2edit is live on npm 🎉

I just published **click2edit** — a tiny inline editing library for small websites.

`npm i click2edit`

### Why I built it
- quick content edits directly on page
- no heavy CMS
- works for landing pages and business sites

### What it includes
- framework-agnostic core (`click2edit`)
- React adapter (`click2edit/react`)
- optional Node server (`click2edit/server`)
- storage adapters: local, http, vercel, custom

### Security model
- supports server-side password validation (`authorize`)
- global persistence via your own backend or Vercel API route

Feedback is welcome — especially from freelancers/agencies shipping marketing sites fast.
